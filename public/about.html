                    Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans,
                    several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more
                    severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory
                    Syndrome
                    (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19.

                    COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently
                    discovered coronavirus. This new virus
                    and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan,
                    China, in December 2019. COVID-19 is now a
                    pandemic affecting many countries globally.

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
                    The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, dry cough, and tiredness.
                    Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or
                    diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people
                    become infected but only have very mild symptoms. Most people (about 80%)
                    recover from the disease without needing hospital treatment. Around 1 out
                    of every 5 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops
                    difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems
                    like high blood pressure, heart and lung problems, diabetes, or cancer , are
                    at higher risk of developing serious illness. However anyone can catch
                    COVID-19 and become seriously ill. Even people with very mild symptoms of
                    COVID-19 can transmit the virus. People of all ages who experience
                    fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.

                    What should I do if I have COVID-19 symptoms and when should I seek medical care?

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
                    If you have minor symptoms, such as a slight cough or a mild fever, there is generally no need to
                    seek
                    medical care. Stay at home, self-isolate and monitor your symptoms. Follow national guidance on
                    self-isolation.

                    However, if you live in an area with malaria or dengue fever it is important that you do not ignore
                    symptoms of fever. Seek medical help. When you attend the health facility wear a mask if possible,
                    keep
                    at least 1 metre distance from other people and do not touch surfaces with your hands. If it is a
                    child
                    who is sick help the child stick to this advice.

                    Seek immediate medical care if you have difficulty breathing or pain/pressure in the chest. If
                    possible,
                    call your health care provider in advance, so he/she can direct you to the right health facility.

                    How does COVID-19 spread?
                </summary>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-800">
                    People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease spreads primarily from person
                    to
                    person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are expelled when a person with COVID-19
                    coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are relatively heavy, do not travel far and quickly sink
                    to
                    the ground. People can catch COVID-19 if they breathe in these droplets from a person infected with
                    the
                    virus. This is why it is important to stay at least 1 metre (3 feet) away from others. These
                    droplets
                    can land on objects and surfaces around the person such as tables, doorknobs and handrails. People
                    can
                    become infected by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. This
                    is
                    why it is important to wash your hands regularly with soap and water or clean with alcohol-based
                    hand
                    rub.

                    WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways that COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share
                    updated
                    findings.
